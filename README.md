## 📚 Learning Path

Currently, I'm focusing on:
- **Deep Learning**: Building neural networks for computer vision and natural language processing.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Exploring the architecture and applications of state-of-the-art models like GPT and BERT.
- **Best Practices in AI Development**: Learning about model optimization, deployment, and ethical AI.
