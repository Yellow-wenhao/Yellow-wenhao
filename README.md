## üìö Learning Path

Currently, I'm focusing on:
- **Deep Learning**: Building neural networks for computer vision and natural language processing.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Exploring the architecture and applications of state-of-the-art models like GPT and BERT.
- **Best Practices in AI Development**: Learning about model optimization, deployment, and ethical AI.

## üöÄ Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **[Image Classification with PyTorch]()** - A deep learning project to classify images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- **[MATLAB Signal Processing]()** - A collection of scripts for analyzing and processing signals in MATLAB.
- **[Chatbot with GPT]()** - A simple chatbot built using OpenAI's GPT model for natural language understanding.
